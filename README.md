# Parallel Convergence

Parallel Convergence is a coaching tool which aims to improve the way coaches 
work with their League of Legends esports teams and was created during the 
2017 Riot Games Hackathon hosted in Riot Games' headquarters in Los Angeles.

## What does it do?

Parallel Convergence enables the synchronization of replays between an arbitrary 
number of clients (this includes the camera position and the game time, controlled 
by the coach). Each client only needs the `.rofl` replay file and the Parallel Convergence
Overwolf App.

The synchronization guarantees that all persons look at the same event in game 
with very low latency (far less than one second). Additionally, everyone is able to add 
annotations (circles, arrows, free hand drawings), which are also synchronized in real time between 
clients. This enables effective communication between the participants of 
a coaching session.
